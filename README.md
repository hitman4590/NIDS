Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering: (Machine learning project) 

Problem statement No â€“ Network Intrusion Detection 

The Challenge: 
Create a robust network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using machine learning. The 
system should be capable of analyzing network traffic data to identify and classify various 
types of cyber-attacks (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) and distinguish them from normal 
network activity. The goal is to build a model that can effectively secure communication 
networks by providing an early warning of malicious activities.
